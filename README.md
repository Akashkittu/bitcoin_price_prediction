# Bitcoin Price Prediction | LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting Bitcoin prices using deep learning techniques. By training a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with TensorFlow and Keras, the system analyzes historical BTC-USD data and predicts future price movements. It includes end-to-end steps for preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features

✅ Bidirectional LSTM for robust sequence modeling of time-series data  
✅ MinMax scaling and sliding window generation for stable training  
✅ Dropout regularization to reduce overfitting  
✅ De-scaling of predictions back to original price units  
✅ Visualization of Actual vs. Predicted and multi-day Future Forecast

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Model building and training  
- **Pandas/NumPy** – Data loading and manipulation  
- **scikit-learn** – MinMaxScaler and utilities  
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting and visualization
